# Fragment generation
 This procedure describes a method for accessing the chemical space of fragments containing fewer than 13 heavy atoms. It is very similar to GDB13, but the code is open source. We have different filters for fragment selection. You can learn the details of fragment generation.
 Please cite the paper (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-022-00598-4) if you use this code.
